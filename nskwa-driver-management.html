Modern Driver Management (not to be confused with MDM, mobile device management) combines new methods for driver management by extending the native capabilities of ConfigMgr. What this solution does, simply put, is to automate the download of driver packages from public system manufacturer web sites. 
Scanner Driver & Software  To download Drivers & Software for your fi Series, ScanSnap or SP Series product, please choose the appropriate link to our global. The Driver Manager connects you with the Fujitsu driver inventory in the Internet, gathers the drivers which are suitable for your network and downloads the complete driver package. Afterwards you have to install the drivers by yourself. DeskUpdate searches the Fujitsu database for new drivers If you use Modern Driver Management, I have questions about how you do things. 1. Did you create a failover driver package? What did you put in it? 2. Are you using MDM's Scheduling feature? If not, how often are you checking for updated drivers/BIOS? 3. Do you test the drivers before putting them into production? How do you test them? Do you test on each computer model that you support? On the one hand, everything should be tested before it goes into production, but on the other In the first part of this two-part series on Key Management, we saw how an increasing number of organizations are encrypting their sensitive data to mitigate cybersecurity risks. Driver turnover can hurt a trucking business pretty badly. When you think about how companies often spend about ,000-to-,000 to recruit a new driver (we’re only talking about one driver here, mind you), you’ll come to realize how driver happiness and retention isn’t something to take lightly.

Our driver offering combines fleet policy, automated driver behavior monitoring, and comprehensive online training to build a culture of safety that minimizes collisions, downtime, and legal expenses. Hi, is anyone using Modern Driver Management to download drivers to ccmcache? So far I only managed to download the drivers during our Windows 10 Upgrade TS, but for some systems this process is super slow so I'd like to move this step to our Pre-Cache TS so it runs without the user noticing. If I download the drivers in the Pre-Cache TS, the content will be deleted once the Pre-Cache TS is finished and I want it to stay in the cache folder.

I'm in the process of testing SCConfigMgr.com (https://SCConfigMgr.com)'s Modern Driver Management. Since I've only spent a day with it, I know someone here knows more about it than I do. The Implementation Guide states that the -Filter options for Invoke-CMApplyDriverPackage.ps1 are 'Driver' or 'Drivers'. Shouldn't the options be 'Drivers' or 'Drivers-Pilot'.

In order to ensure the success of your business, you need the proper tools to make drivers productive, efficient, and safe. Monitoring driving habits for areas of improvement can be a very valuable practice. I am using the driver automation tool along with the modern driver management solution ( https://www.scconfigmgr.com/modern-driver-management/ (https://www.scconfigmgr.com/modern-driver-management/)). I'm mainly using it to install drivers and update BIOS during OSD. Everything has been working great since I've implemented it but recently it appears that Intel video drivers are not installing. We have various Dell desktops models (9020, 7040 etc) and when we first noticed the issue, driver.

I am often asked what the best way is to manage drivers with both BDD/MDT and ConfigMgr. With this in mind I thought I would create two blog posts dealing with this topic. The first post (this one) will cover ConfigMgr and the second BDD/MDT driver management. Please I posted here (https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/9r87zo/new_rollup_for_1806_kb4462978/e8nhuqz/) on an old topic, but i thought i'd post new as well. I'm receiving the following error in during the "applying drivers" step of the task sequence. This happens for both Dell and Lenovo devices even though it identifies the correct model.

I just downloaded AMD 18.10 chipset driver for my mobo from AMD's website and installed it successfully (from 17.12 to 18.10). When I go into Device Management tho, whichever core's properties I view, it says my driver is from 2009 and the driver provider is Microsoft. I've tried locating the driver via Device Management manually and it says the best driver is already installed. The event log shows also that I installed something but the "Microsoft" thing is bugging me. What did I do wrong. I am having issues with applying drivers for an HP EliteDesk 800 G2 DM 35W I've used the tool to download and match my drivers and I have a driver published but during the matching step it returns nothing. /u/Maurice-Daly ===== SCConfigMgr Invoke-CMApplyDriverPackage Version 2.1.5 ==== 1/1/1601 12:00:00 AM 0 (0x0000) Driver download package process initiated 1/1/1601 12:00:00 AM 0 (0x0000) Manufacturer determined as: Hewlett-Packard 1/1/1601 12:00:00 AM 0 (0x0000) Computer model deter. My team is currently trying to implement the Modern Driver Management tool in our environment. The tool was originally setup by someone who no longer works with us, and was working properly at one time. Nothing in particular has changed since, but we are continually getting Exit Code 4 ( An error occured while calling ConfigMgr WebService to determine OS Image architecture ) during the OSD Task Sequence. The web service is working correctly because we can access it through a browser 
Good Morning Everyone, I am trying to get SCConfigMgr's Modern Driver Management ( Specifically the Driver Automation Tool ) to connect to my Site Server however it refuses to. I know the Site Server name and the Site Code however even when trying an None FQDN or the IP Address of the server it refuses to connect either. I have run the applicaton from my workstation and from the server my Site is on. Windows Firewall isn't on either. Is there something in the ConfigMgr server's configuratio. Hello guys! I can't understand why these script with dynamically appling drivers doesn't work. We use SCCM 2012 r2 at our environment with Windows 10 1803 ADK. All Optional Components for Boot image is enable. When I'm trying to use these script : https://github.com/SCConfigMgr/ConfigMgr/blob/master/Operating%20System%20Deployment/Drivers/Invoke-CMApplyDriverPackage.ps1 (https://github.com/SCConfigMgr/ConfigMgr/blob/master/Operating%20System%20Deployment/Drivers/Invoke-CMApplyDriverPackage.ps. Using script Modern Driver Management 2.1.5 Invoke-CMApplyDriverPackage.ps1 I have replaced my apply driver package portion with this script. However on first boot after applying the system never boots and the power profile seems to be max. If I power off and power back on it resumes just fine and applies the drivers appropriately. After the apply driver step I have Set Status 3 Setup Windows and configmgr then Restart computer (current installed default OS) Is there something. Hey, just wondering if anyone here has set up the MDM Tool to run as a scheduled task? I want to run it monthly just for new BIOS updates but I find the documentation a little unclear on one point. Namely, how does it know what to download? Do you just select all the BIOS models you want in the GUI, then create the task (again via the GUI) and does it all auto-magically? Basically, I don't want it importing new drivers every month (at least not yet - we're still deciding how best to driver. 
I'm having the worst time trying to get this to work for my Task Sequence. I have a bare metal task sequence that will choose which "Apply Operating System" step based on a section made in the UI++ tool. The problem is when the MDM tries to apply the drivers, it has issues auto detecting which image to scan for OS version. In the Invoke script, there is a section that references a "-OSImageTSVariableName" switch that I'm supposed to be able to use. I keep getting my beloved "An error occured. Hi guys, I'm moving away from MDT and towards SCCM for OSD. I'm just trying to understand how duplicate drivers are handled and where they are stored. For example, say I have two computer models and one driver package for each. There are some shared drivers, and these drivers get an appended category and exist in both driver packages. Where is the actual file stored? Is it in both driver package sources, or just the first packages source that I imported the drivers into? Basically If anyone is familiar with Modern Driver Management and the problem I am having, I would appreciate the help. I'm having an issue with the MDM/MBM Diags in the Driver Automation Tool (new installation). When I click 'connect configmgr web service' i get the result: 'An error occured while calling ConfigMgr WebService for a list of available packages. Error message: You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.' (p.s. occurred. How do you all handle duplicate drivers on import? I currently use the "Total Control" method of driver injection and organize my drivers in two folders: 1. `By Vendor` - this contains a folder per vendor driver pack. For example, I have a folder for Dell R7xx drivers, one for Cisco UCS Cxxx drivers and so on. I also have folders for specific drivers used by custom devices. 1. `By System` - the "Total Control" folder tree. Folder and sub-folder per manufacturer and model. Each leaf folder. Happy Friday Folks! I'm doing a bit of cleanup on our drivers this morning. I've kinda let it go for too long and our disk with all of our CM content is getting full. I guess the main question is what is actually NEEDED for drivers? I download the vendor provided (Lenovo) driver packs and unzip and import. The issue is that we have quite a few different models and each pack is 1-2GB in size. There seems to be a lot of extraneous files included in these packs. Is there a way to downsize Hi all, some of you might read my other post about how to get started in a new company where SCCM is somewhat a "garbage bin". Here is my next question. How do I efficiently manage the Drivers (Tab)? we \~13k drivers loaded into SCCM. I've already deleted some of the source folders, where I know these aren't needed anymore. EDIT: seemingly there is no "Apply Drivers" or something like that in our TS's - do I really need to keep these old drivers Hi all, Looking for some help implementing modern driver management in our environment. I believe everything is installed correctly, however I am getting the error shown in the linked ApplyDriverPackage logs: https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9iwueq2keb1io2/ApplyDriverPackage.log?dl=0 and show below: gt'Package content download process failed with return code -2147024809 The SMTS logs are just saying: gt Failed to move package PRD00166 from '' to 'C:\_SMSTaskSequence\DriverPackage\PRD00166'. I typically format and start fresh, even wiping the partitions that come with Dell laptops. Just wondering if you guys use the Dell utilities or just pick and choose which drivers to download </p>
